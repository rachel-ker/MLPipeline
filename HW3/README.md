results will appear in csv file  
  
## Files:  
pipeline.py - code for train-test split and evaluation  
etl.py - code to read, explore, transform data to be ready to build classifiers  
classifiers.py - code to build each specific classifier and to specify parameters  
iteratemodels.py - code to iterate through the different parameters and evaluate the models 
  
hw3-writeup.pdf - short report on findings
